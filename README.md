# QuickBite Express — Crisis Recovery Analytics

Tools: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib), SQL, Power BI/Tableau, Excel
Techniques: EDA, Customer Analytics, RFM Segmentation, Churn Analysis, SLA Performance, Partner Scoring, Data Visualization

This project analyzes the real impact of a major food-safety crisis on QuickBite Express, a Bengaluru-based food-tech platform. Using restaurant, customer, and order-level datasets, I conducted a detailed end-to-end analysis of user churn, order volume drop, delivery delays, cancellation spikes, and sentiment changes during the 2025 crisis period.

I built an interactive Recovery Dashboard to track key business metrics across pre-crisis, crisis, and recovery phases. The project includes customer segmentation (RFM), churn identification, delivery SLA analysis, and partner restaurant evaluation using a multi-factor “Partner Priority Score.”

### Key Contributions

a) Analyzed >200K orders to identify behavior shifts across pre-crisis, crisis, and recovery phases.

b) Built customer segments (Champions, Loyal, At-Risk, Lost) and highlighted high-value users for targeted reactivation.

c) Evaluated 10,000+ restaurant partners using rating, delivery performance, cancellations, and order volume metrics.

d) Designed a comprehensive Recovery Dashboard to support leadership decision-making.

e) Proposed data-driven campaigns to rebuild customer trust, improve SLA performance, and retain high-value partners.

### Project Outcomes

a) Clear understanding of customer churn drivers and recovery opportunities.

b) Identification of restaurant partners critical for long-term growth.

Operational insights on delivery delays and cancellation causes.

Strategic recommendations to accelerate platform recovery and user retention.
